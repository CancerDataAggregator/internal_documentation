# CDA-HelpDesk Infrastructure

## Overview

CDA-HelpDesk is written in the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) language, and the files are arranged in a standard folder-per-topic format, [saved in Github](https://github.com/CancerDataAggregator/CDA-HelpDesk). The files transform into HTML, so they can be published as a website using a tool called [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).  We use [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for styling and many of the features (toolbars, search, etc) that make the website navigatable. The website is build and hosted at [ReadTheDocs](https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/cda/) on a paid account. The web domain is owned by NCI/CRDC.
